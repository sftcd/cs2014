<h1>Overview of CS2014 systems programming</h1>

<p>This is the 2017 version. Last updated 20170926 by <a href="mailto:stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie">stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie</a></p> 
<ul>
  <li>The canonical URL for this stuff is: <a
    href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/">https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/</a>
  <ul><li>I use github for source control so the latest source will be at 
	<a href="https://github.com/sftcd/cs2014">https://github.com/sftcd/cs2014</a>. Feel free
	to submit a PR if interested.</li>
	<li>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you clone a copy of that repo. Figuring out how do that is an exercise for
 		your first lab.</li>
    </ul></li>

  <li>The <a href="#Lecture">Lecture slides</a> section below has links to ppt
    versions of all the lectures for the course. </li>
  <li>The <a href="materials/README.html">Materials</a> page has links to local and/or remote copies of
    some of the background information/papers etc. For exam purposes, you won't
    need all of these, just what's discussed in class,  but you may be interested.</li>
  <li>The <a href="examples/README.html">Examples directory</a> contains a bunch of
    samples we'll use in class.</a>


  <li>There will be six <a href="#labs">assignments</a>, totalling 20% of the marks for the module
    (so the exam is worth 80%). The deadlines for the assignments are hard deadlines, missing them
	means losing significant marks. 
  	<ul>
		<li> You have to pass the assignments and exam separately, that is, you need to get above 40% in both.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Note that I may be changing the slides/materials as I go. Depending on stuff
that's more than two weeks ahead of time may be wasted effort:-)</li>

		<li>The Teaching Assistant for this course is <a
href="mailto:cabrerac@scss.tcd.ie">Christian Cabrera</a>, please send him
questions related to assignments/labs. For other questions feel free to send me
<a href="mailto:stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie">email</a>
.</li>

	<li>Plagiarism note: it is enirely ok to talk to other students about the assignments and coding issues, and
you are encouraged to do that and to help one another. It is not ok to copy someone else's code, nor to write
code for someone else. We have tools to check. And if in doubt, we will require students to explain their
submitted code face-to-face. We will randomly select some students/assignments for such checking and request 
attendance at labs for that purpose from time to time.</li>

  <li>This course was previously taught by <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/">David Gregg</a>, his 
	course materials are <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/cs2014/">here</a>, are still relevant,
	and should provide a useful 2nd view to the more-or-less the same material.
  	<ul> 
		<li>You can look some of David's old exams from
	<a href="https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/exams/assets/local/past-papers2016/CS/CS2014-2.PDF">2016</a>
	and
	<a href="https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/exams/assets/local/past-papers2015/CS/CS2014-2.PDF">2015</a>.
	This year's exam will be similar, though I'm thinking of adding some multple-choice questions instead of all essay-style - I'll let you know.

<h2><a neme="labs">Labs and Assignments</a></h2>

<p>Labs will be in LG12, on Thursdays from noon-4pm. Some subset of the teaching assistant,
myself and
the two demonstrators will be in LG12 during that period, so please do come along if
you need help or have questions about the lectures or assignments. 
As the room isn't 
big enough, when attending labs, please adhere to the 
following groupings:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Group 1: 12.00-12.50: Students whose surname begins with a letter between "P" and "Z".</li>
    <li>Group 2: 13.00-13.50: Students whose surname begins with a letter between "K" and "O"</li>
    <li>Group 3: 14.00-14.50: Students whose surname begins with a letter between "D" and "J"</li>
    <li>Group 4: 15.00-15.50: Students whose surname has a prefix between "A" and "C" </li>
</ul>

<p>We strongly encourage you to get to the first lab, to ensure you
have sorted out logins etc. and are basically familiar with the tools.
If you don't, you will likely regret that. (There is no assignment
for the first lab.) After that, you can do the assignments by yourself
or in the labs as you choose.</p>

<p>Submission of assignments will be via the TBD system.</p>

<p>Details of the <a href="./assignments/README.html">assignments</a> will be published as we get to them, at
which point links will appear below. General instructions <a href="assignments/README.html">here</a>.</p>
